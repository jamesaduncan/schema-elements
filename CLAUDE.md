# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Code should always be beautiful. Especially code that is about to be released.

## Beautiful code

Beautiful code, is well-factored code, and code-paths should not be duplicated.
Beautiful code is well tested code, and all code-paths have accompanying tests that are easy for the developer to run.
Beautiful code has named methods and function that explain their purpose, and won't confused the reader by being misnamed.
Beautiful code doesn't have extra debugging information in it.
Beautiful code is also well documented.

More importantly, and this is ** CRITICAL **, is that the code works as intended at all times.

## Project Overview

SchemaElements is a vanilla JavaScript library for working with HTML Microdata elements. It provides extraction, rendering, synchronization, and validation of schema data within the DOM without any external dependencies.

## API

The API is documented in SCHEMA-API.md

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
 
The Implementation Plan is documented in SCHEMA-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

## Testing

All tests should go in the test directory. The main test file that links to
all the other tests is tests/index.html.

Test files are written into the directory `/tests`

```bash
# run the web server, and open the test file
npx http-server -o <FILEPATH>
```
